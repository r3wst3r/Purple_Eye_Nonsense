I’ve only gotten to train with Bill once so far, but he’s as humble as a walking force of nature can be, and a phenominal instructor. I carry one of Bill’s original production [AMTAC Northman](https://amtacblades.com/) blades everywhere I can legally carry it, which is to say virtually everywhere. The knife is probably the earliest crafted tool in human history, and though seemingly lost on humans of the modern first-world, the ability to cut and to make fire have been a critical human skill for all of our existence. While neither blade nor flame are neither normal necessities of the modern world, I believe we've begun to shed those tools prematurely, and that in the long-term this complacency will lead to us becoming less civilized, not more. Again, one man's opinon and while arguably still within broad of scope of my Substack I'm tidying up, it merits enumeration, and it does feed into overall mindset. Another reason for this is that I don't want to give readers who do not know me personally the wrong idea about my values, or portray myself as some violence-crazed lunatic. I abhor violence, but ascribe to the belief that it is better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war, and I'm not trying to wax Bushido, but training for it does bring a level of inner peace that isn't there when I don't train. I'm not trying to pen a manifesto or anything here, just had to throw that out there so I have a sign to tap if I give anyone the wrong idea by writing about some of this stuff. I know it isn't everybody's cup of tea.
