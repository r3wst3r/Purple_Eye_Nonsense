Combat Hunter is a much better USMC resource for mindset cultivation than [Marine Corps Martial Arts Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Martial_Arts_Program) IMHO
</br>
MCMAP attempts to teach mindset, but in the author’s experience this objective is heavily dependent on the enthusiasm of the student’s instructor and peer group, and while there were a few good moves in the curriculum up to Green Belt, the arm bar takedown in particular stands out as the biggest takeaway from my MCMAP instruction. Although the Marine Corps was my muse for many of my ideas, and although my martial arts training has influenced my views on mindset, I feel compelled to say that about MCMAP was not a major influence, along with my genuine hope that my sentiment is dated and MCMAP training is conducted differently than it was “back in my day.”

If any Marine Corps leadership is reading this, I can discuss this in further detail and would love to offer some potential solutions for these problems I'm calling out in as great a level of detail as you wish.
